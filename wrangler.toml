# Note: This is a basic configuration for Cloudflare Pages.
# Since this is a Streamlit application that requires a Python server,
# the recommended deployment method is using Cloudflare Tunnel with Docker.
# See CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions.

# For full Streamlit functionality, use:
# - Cloudflare Tunnel + Docker (recommended)
# - See CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md for complete setup guide
